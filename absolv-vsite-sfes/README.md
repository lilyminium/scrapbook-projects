# VSite HFEs with AbSolv

Experimenting with running HFEs with absolv.

- a test of a molecule with OPC and OPC3 executes successfully in an hour or so
- a test of a molecule with solute vsites fails

Note -- to run absolv with 4-site water, you'll need the `add-vsite-support` branch of [my fork](https://github.com/lilyminium/absolv).
